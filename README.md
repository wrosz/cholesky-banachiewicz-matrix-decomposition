# Project: Modified Cholesky-Banachiewicz Method for Solving Linear Systems

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to implement and analyze the modified Cholesky-Banachiewicz method for solving the linear system:

\[
A x = b
\]

where \( A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \) is a positive definite symmetric tridiagonal matrix, and \( b \in \mathbb{R}^n \).

## Report
The final report for the project can be found in the file **sprawozdanie_projekt2.pdf**.

## Source Files
The Matlab source files are located in the folder **MN_projekt2_Roszkowski**, which contains the following:

- **skrypt_test.m**: The script used for testing and implementation of the method.
- Other files: Definitions of the functions used within the script.

The details can be found in the comments within the code.
